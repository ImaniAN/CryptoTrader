<h2><img src="https://seleniumbase.io/img/logo6.png" title="SeleniumBase" width="32" /> How it works:</h2>

At the core, SeleniumBase works by extending [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) as a direct plugin. SeleniumBase automatically spins up web browsers for tests, and then gives those tests access to the SeleniumBase libraries through the [BaseCase class](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/fixtures/base_case.py). Tests are also given access to [SeleniumBase command-line arguments](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/customizing_test_runs.md) and [SeleniumBase methods](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/method_summary.md), which provide additional functionality.

(NOTE: pytest uses a feature called test discovery to automatically find and run Python methods that start with "``test_``" from the file that you specified on the command line.)

To use SeleniumBase calls you need the following:

```python
from seleniumbase import BaseCase
```

And then have your test classes inherit BaseCase:

```python
class MyTestClass(BaseCase):
```

(See the example test, [my_first_test.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/examples/my_first_test.py), for reference.)
