### Building a browser-based test automation server on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) by using [SeleniumBase](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase)

(This tutorial, [from a previous Google Cloud Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Google-Cloud-Meetup/events/230839686/?showDescription=true), will teach you how to setup a Linux server for running automated browser tests. The cost of running this server is about [$13.61/month on Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/bitnami-launchpad/jenkins) (enough to handle **5 parallel tests**). This is less expensive than using other platforms such as [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/pricing) or [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/pricing).)

([Here's a quick video recap on YouTube:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-sno20R9P0))

#### Step 1. Open the Google Cloud Platform Cloud Launcher

* Navigate to [https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher](https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher)
* (If you already have an active Google Cloud project, the Google Cloud Launcher will probably default to using that. If you don't, [sign up for the free trial of Google Cloud Platform here](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to get started.)

#### Step 2. Launch a Jenkins instance

![](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/gcp_cloud_launcher_jenkins_3.png "Finding Jenkins")

* Under "Cloud Launcher", Click on "Jenkins Certified by Bitnami"
* Click on "Launch on Compute Engine"
* Give the instance a name
* Give the instance a zone
* Click "Create"

#### Step 3. Connect with your new Jenkins instance

![](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/gcp_ssh.png "SSH into your Jenkins instance")

* SSH into your new instance by selecting: "SSH" => "Open in browser window" from the instance page.

#### Step 4. Clone the SeleniumBase repository from the root ("/") directory.

```bash
cd /
sudo git clone https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git
```

#### Step 5. Enter the "linux" folder

```bash
cd SeleniumBase/integrations/linux/
```

#### Step 6. Give Jenkins (aka "tomcat" user) sudo access (See [tomcat_permissions.sh](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/integrations/linux/tomcat_permissions.sh) for details)

```bash
./tomcat_permissions.sh
```

#### Step 7. Become "tomcat" (the Jenkins user) and enter a "bash" shell

```bash
sudo su tomcat
bash
```

#### Step 8. Install dependencies (See [Linuxfile.sh](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/integrations/linux/Linuxfile.sh) for details)

```bash
./Linuxfile.sh
```

#### Step 9. Start up the headless browser display mechanism: Xvfb (See [Xvfb_launcher.sh](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/integrations/linux/Xvfb_launcher.sh) for details)

```bash
./Xvfb_launcher.sh
```

#### Step 10. Go to the SeleniumBase directory

```bash
cd /SeleniumBase
```

#### Step 11. Install the [requirements](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/requirements.txt) for SeleniumBase

```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

#### Step 12. Install SeleniumBase

```bash
sudo python setup.py develop
```

#### Step 13. Run an [example test](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/examples/my_first_test.py) on Chrome to verify installation (May take up to 10 seconds)

![](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/gcp_bitnami.png "Linux SSH Terminal")

```bash
pytest examples/my_first_test.py --headless
```

#### Step 14. If you like nosetests better than pytest, that works too

```bash
nosetests examples/my_first_test.py --headless
```

#### Step 15. You can also verify that the example test runs on Firefox

```bash
nosetests examples/my_first_test.py --headless --browser=firefox
```

#### Step 16. Login to Jenkins

* (The url, as well as username and password, should be accessible from your Google Cloud Platform VM instance page.)

#### Step 17. Create a new Jenkins job

![](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/gcp_jenkins_new_job_2.png "Create a Jenkins job")

* Click on "New Item"
* Give your new Jenkins job a name (ex: "My_First_Test")
* Select "Freestyle project"
* Click "OK"

#### Step 18. Setup your new Jenkins job

* Under "Source Code Management", select "Git".
* For the "Repository URL", put: ``https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git``. (You'll eventually be using your own clone of the repository here.)
* Under "Build", click the "Add build step" dropdown and then select "Execute shell".
* For the "Command", put:
```bash
pytest examples/my_first_test.py --headless
```
* Click "Save" when you're done.

#### Step 19. Run your new Jenkins job

* Click on "Build Now"
* (If all the setup was done correctly, you should see a blue dot appear after a few seconds, indicating that the test job passed.)

#### Step 20. Future Work

If you have a web application that you want to test, you'll be able to create SeleniumBase tests and add them to Jenkins as you saw here. You may want to create a Deploy job, which downloads the latest version of your repository, and then kicks off all tests to run after that. You could then tell that Deploy job to auto-run whenever a change is pushed to your repository by using: "Poll SCM". All your tests would then be able to run by using: "Build after other projects are built". You can also use MySQL to save test results in the DB so that you can query the data at any time.

#### Congratulations! You're now well on your way to becoming a build & release / automation engineer!

## MySQL DB setup instructions

#### Step 21. Return to the Google Cloud Launcher and launch a MySQL Instance

![](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/gcp_mysql.png "Finding MySQL")

* Under "Featured Solutions", Click on "MySQL"
* Click on "Launch on Compute Engine"
* Give the instance a name
* Give the instance a zone
* Click "Create"

#### Step 22. Get the Connection credentials for your new MySQL Instance

* Under the Google Cloud Platform menu, go to "Compute Engine"
* Find your new MySQL instance and then write down the value written in the "External IP" section.
* Under the Google Cloud Platform menu, go to "Deployment Manager"
* Find your new MySQL instance and then click on it.
* Write down the values for Admin username and password. (Username should be "root")

#### Step 23. Get a MySQL GUI tool so that you can connect to your MySQL Instance

* You can download [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/tools/workbench/) for this.

#### Step 24. Create a new connection to your MySQL Instance

* Use the MySQL DB credentials that you saved in Step 21 for this.

#### Step 25. Create a new database/schema in your MySQL Instance

* You can name your database/schema ``test_db``.

#### Step 26. Create the necessary tables in your MySQL database/schema

* Run the [create_db_tables.sql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/master/seleniumbase/core/create_db_tables.sql) script in your MySQL database/schema to create all the required DB tables. 

#### Step 27. Have your local clone of SeleniumBase connect to your MySQL DB Instance

* Update the MySQL connection details in your [settings.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/config/settings.py) file to use the credentials that you saved in Step 21.

#### Step 28. Have your SeleniumBase Jenkins jobs use your MySQL DB Instance

* For the "Execute shell", use the following as your updated "Command":

```bash
pytest examples/test_suite.py --headless --with-db_reporting
```

* Click "Save" when you're done.

#### Step 29. Run your new Jenkins job

* Click on "Build Now"
* If all goes well, you should be seeing new rows appear in your MySQL DB tables.

#### Step 30. Congratulations! You've successfully completed this tutorial!
